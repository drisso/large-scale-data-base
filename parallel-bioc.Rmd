# (PART) Parallelization and Working in the Cloud {-}

# Parallization in Bioconductor {#parallel-bioc}

**To add**: Parallelization with disk-backed data.

- Parallelization performance depends heavily on (A) the choice of backend, and (B) your computer's hardware.
- Some rules of thumb:
  - Parallelization is never as straightforward or provides as big an improvement as you think/hope.
  - Parallel *writing* to files (e.g. HDF5 files) is a no go.
  - Parallel *reading* from files is sometimes, maybe, perhaps okay ...
