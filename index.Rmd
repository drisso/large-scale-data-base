This is the website for the online textbook **"Orchestrating Large-Scale Data Analysis with Bioconductor"**.

This textbook describes the steps in a computational analysis pipeline for working with **large data** using the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) framework and R programming language. The analysis pipeline is built up as a series of steps, each described in a chapter in the main section, with complete examples and workflows using R code and data that can be run on your own laptop.
